**Ava, a new golden tiger at Chiang Mai Night Safari, is now a rising star among Thai netizens, after pictures showing her beautiful eyes and elegant posture went viral.**

Chiang Mai Night Safari posted images of Ava, a 3-year-old Bengal tiger, on its Facebook page, with a caption that reads: “My name is Ava. I am Luna’s sister.”

As of Thursday, the post had received 31k likes, 2.7k comments and 25k shares. 

Netizens compliment her on her grateful posture and some even said that she is too cute to be a tiger.

Chiang Mai Night Safari explained that Ava is a Bengal tiger with a colour variation caused by a recessive gene, adding “They are a rare breed, with only 50-100 of them in the world.”

Chiang Mai Night Safari is open to visitors daily, from 11am to 2pm, at the Tiger World zone, where they can meet both Ava and Luna.
